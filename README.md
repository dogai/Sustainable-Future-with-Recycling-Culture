In response to the escalating pollution levels caused by waste cooking oil, this project focuses on
implementing recycling initiatives throughout Turkey. The strategy involves multifaceted approaches:

  1. Stakeholder Engagement
      Collaboration with key governmental bodies such as the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization,
      Ministry of Energy, and municipalities of major cities, as well as partnerships with renowned
      environmental organizations like TEMA Foundation and WWF Turkey.

  2. Educational Outreach
      Providing comprehensive training programs aimed at restaurant and small business owners to educate
      them on effective waste oil management practices. By equipping them with the knowledge and skills to
      reuse, recycle, or dispose of waste oil responsibly, we aim to significantly reduce its environmental
      impact.

  3. Public Awareness Campaign
      Utilizing various communication channels, including television announcements, public transportation
      advertisements, and distribution of informative brochures, to raise awareness among the general
      population about the importance of recycling waste cooking oil. Short films and commercials will
      illustrate simple methods for recycling oil at home, making the concept easily accessible and
      understandable to everyone.

By executing these steps, our objective is to establish a robust infrastructure for waste cooking oil recycling 
initially in major cities within the first 12 months. Subsequently, we aim to expand the initiative to encompass
all cities across Turkey within the following 12 months, fostering a culture of sustainability and environmental
consciousness nationwide.
